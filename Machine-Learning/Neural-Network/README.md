## `Neural-Network.py`
Implements a neural network that learns to correctly identify hand-written digits. Finite Differencing is then used to test the accuracy of the gradient descent used in this neural network.

### `NN-Output.txt`
Shows the accuracy of the neural network in each epoch and shows the accuracy of the algorithm's gradient descent via finite differencing.

### `trainx.csv`
These are the images of hand written digits the neural network is trained on.

### `testx.csv`
These are the images of hand written digits the neural network is tested on.

### `trainy.csv`
These are the values of hand written digits the neural network is trained on; that is, it contains the number that each hand-written digit represents.

### `testy.csv`
These are the values of hand written digits the neural network is tested on; that is, it contains the number that each hand-written digit represents.
