## `aligner.py`
Performs Needleman_Wunsch on input DNA or amino acid sequences to align them.

### `amino_acid_output.txt`
Ouput from `aligner.py` when amino acid sequences are input from COVID Vaccine and the COVID Virus.

### `HSP82_promoter_sequence.fasta` 
Input to `aligner.py`. This is the COVID DNA sequence preceding the gene that codes for spike protein.s

### `moderna_mrna.fna` 
Input to `aligner.py`. This is the COVID vaccine from Moderna.
